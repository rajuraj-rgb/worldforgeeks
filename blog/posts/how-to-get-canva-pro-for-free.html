            Canva for education is a campaign designed by Canva to support education by providing Canva Pro for free.

However, you must have an .edu email address to get your free Canva Pro lifetime account as a student or teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you don't have a .edu email address I'll show you how to quickly get a temporary .edu email address and how to use it to get Canva for free.
        </p>
        <p>
            The below steps will help you get a lifetime Canva Pro account for free:
        </p>
        <h2 class="dark-mode light-mode">
            1. Get a Temporary Email Address:
        </h2>
        <p>
            The first step to getting a free Canva Pro account is to get a temporary .edu email address. Visit this site <a target="_blank" href="https://10minutesemail.net">10minutesmail.net</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            On this website you can create your .edu e-mail address needed to set up a Canva for Education account. You'll see an email ID on the dashboard that automatically activates and valid for 10 minutes.

If you were able to successfully obtain your temporary .edu email address, go to step 2. If not, click the delete icon. You will then see the new email address that was created for you.
        </p>
        <h2 class="dark-mode light-mode">
            2. Go to Canva for Education Page
        </h2>
        <p>
            Once you have successfully gotten your .edu email address
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul class="steps">
                <li>
                    Proceed to Canva for Education web address (https://www.canva.com/edu-signup).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click on Signup with email and put in your temporary .edu email address. You will receive One Time Password (OTP) on the email inbox
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enter the OTP and click on submit
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>

            3. Update Your Email Address
        </h2>
        <p>
            As you already know, the .edu email address is only valid for 10 mins, therefore, you need to change the email address in your Canva pro account.
        </p>
        <p>
            To change your Canva email address, go to <a href="https://www.canva.com/settings/your-account" target="_blank">https://www.canva.com/settings/your-account</a> and enter your active email address.
